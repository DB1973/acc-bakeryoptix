AO bakery for Assetto Corsa, powered by NVIDIA OptiX Prime, supports tracks and cars (and requires **v0.1.25-preview194** version 
of Custom Shaders Patch to work). 

To run it on CPU, open `baked_shadow_params.ini` and set `CPU_ONLY = 1`, although at least on my PC with GTX 1060 it runs about 
100 times faster with hardware acceleration.

Still in development, so don’t bake too much stuff. Let’s make sure it works all right first, so we won’t have to rebake everything.
